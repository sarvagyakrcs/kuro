# Contributing to Kuro

Welcome to Kuro! We're excited that you're interested in contributing. This guide will help you understand our project structure and how you can contribute to different verticals.

## Getting Started with Bun

Before contributing, you'll need to set up Bun:

### Installing Bun
```bash
# For macOS, Linux, and WSL
curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash

# Verify installation

```

### Setting up your fork
```bash
# Fork the repository on GitHub first, then:
git clone https://github.com/yourUsername/kuro.git
cd kuro

# Add upstream remote
git remote add upstream https://github.com/yourUsername/kuro.git

# Install dependencies for each vertical
cd kuro-frontend && bun install
cd ../kuro-backend && bun install
cd ../kuro-marketing && bun install
```

## How to Contribute

1. Fork the repository (see "Setting up your fork" above)
2. Create a new branch for your feature:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```
3. Make your changes
4. Test your changes:
   ```bash
   bun test # in the relevant vertical directory
   ```
5. Commit your changes:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat: describe your changes"
   ```
6. Push to your fork:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name

## Coding Standards

- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Follow the existing code style
- Write meaningful commit messages (follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/))
- Document new features or changes
- Add comments for complex logic

## Testing

Each vertical has its own testing requirements:
- Frontend: Component and integration tests
- Backend: API, unit tests, and AI agent tests
- Marketing: Page rendering and accessibility tests

## Getting Help

If you need help:
- Check existing issues
- Create a new issue with a detailed description
- Join our community discussions

## Difficulty Levels Explained

### Why Marketing is Easiest
- More straightforward content management
- Less complex state management
- Mainly static content
- Good documentation and examples
- **Current Focus**: Content creation rather than technical implementation

### Why Frontend is Intermediate
- Complex state management
- Rich UI interactions
- Real-time features
- Performance optimization
- Extensive component library
- Form validation and handling
- Data visualization
- Cross-browser compatibility
- **Current Focus**: Backend integration and real-time features

### Why Backend is Most Complex
- Requires deep understanding of AI systems and agents
- Complex WebSocket implementation for real-time communication
- Sophisticated error handling and edge cases
- Performance optimization for AI operations
- Stream processing and management
- Scalability considerations
- Security implementation
- State management across distributed systems
- **Current Focus**: AI agent implementation and API development

## Best Practices

1. Always work on a feature branch
2. Keep PRs focused and small
3. Update documentation as needed
4. Test your changes thoroughly
5. Follow the code review process
